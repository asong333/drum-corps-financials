## Project Overview

This is a personal data analysis project I created to analyze financial data of drum corps. Drum corps, essentially professional marching bands, are nonprofits and facing growing financial challenges. Here is how the project was completed:

1. All data was pulled manually from Form 990s, a type of IRS filing typically filed by nonprofits. Form 990s are publicly available on [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/). Data for all drum corps were copied into a CSV file.
2. [Queries](drum_corps.sql) were written using **DBeaver** to import data into **PostgreSQL** table and create financial ratios dataset
3. Data sets (source data and data from SQL query) were imported into **PowerBI**
4. [PowerBI dashboard](drum_corps_viz.pdf) was created
5. Comprehensive report was written including takeaways, recommendations, and data visualizations

The final report can be found here: [Final Report](drum_corps_financials_report.pdf)
